## Description

You are given two integers, `num` and `t`.

An integer `x` is called **achievable** if it can become equal to `num` after
applying the following operation no more than `t` times:

  * Increase or decrease `x` by `1`, and simultaneously increase or decrease `num` by `1`.

Return _the maximum possible achievable number_. It can be proven that there
exists at least one achievable number.



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 4, t = 1    Output: 6    Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:    1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.     It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.        

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 3, t = 2    Output: 7    Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num:     1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.    2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.    It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.    



**Constraints:**

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `threshold`.

Find the length of the **longest subarray** of `nums` starting at index `l`
and ending at index `r` `(0 <= l <= r < nums.length)` that satisfies the
following conditions:

  * `nums[l] % 2 == 0`
  * For all indices `i` in the range `[l, r - 1]`, `nums[i] % 2 != nums[i + 1] % 2`
  * For all indices `i` in the range `[l, r]`, `nums[i] <= threshold`

Return _an integer denoting the length of the longest such subarray._

**Note:** A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within
an array.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [3,2,5,4], threshold = 5    Output: 3    Explanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 3 => [2,5,4]. This subarray satisfies the conditions.    Hence, the answer is the length of the subarray, 3. We can show that 3 is the maximum possible achievable length.

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [1,2], threshold = 2    Output: 1    Explanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 1 => [2].     It satisfies all the conditions and we can show that 1 is the maximum possible achievable length.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices `i`, `j`
where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` is called beautiful if the **first digit** of
`nums[i]` and the **last digit** of `nums[j]` are **coprime**.

Return _the total number of beautiful pairs in_`nums`.

Two integers `x` and `y` are **coprime** if there is no integer greater than 1
that divides both of them. In other words, `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x,
y) == 1`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the **greatest common divisor** of `x` and `y`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]    Output: 5    Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.    When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.    Thus, we return 5.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [11,21,12]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.    Thus, we return 2.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices `i`, `j`
where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` is called beautiful if the **first digit** of
`nums[i]` and the **last digit** of `nums[j]` are **coprime**.

Return _the total number of beautiful pairs in_`nums`.

Two integers `x` and `y` are **coprime** if there is no integer greater than 1
that divides both of them. In other words, `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x,
y) == 1`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the **greatest common divisor** of `x` and `y`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]    Output: 5    Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.    When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.    When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.    Thus, we return 5.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [11,21,12]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:    When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.    When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.    Thus, we return 2.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 100`

            Input: words = [""cd"",""ac"",""dc"",""ca"",""zz""]    Output: 2    Explanation: In this example, we can form 2 pair of strings in the following way:    - We pair the 0th string with the 2nd string, as the reversed string of word[0] is ""dc"" and is equal to words[2].    - We pair the 1st string with the 3rd string, as the reversed string of word[1] is ""ca"" and is equal to words[3].    It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""ab"",""ba"",""cc""]    Output: 1    Explanation: In this example, we can form 1 pair of strings in the following way:    - We pair the 0th string with the 1st string, as the reversed string of words[1] is ""ab"" and is equal to words[0].    It can be proven that 1 is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: words = [""aa"",""ab""]    Output: 0    Explanation: In this example, we are unable to form any pair of strings.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 50`
  * `words[i].length == 2`
  * `words` consists of distinct strings.
  * `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Description

A truck has two fuel tanks. You are given two integers, `mainTank`
representing the fuel present in the main tank in liters and `additionalTank`
representing the fuel present in the additional tank in liters.

The truck has a mileage of `10` km per liter. Whenever `5` liters of fuel get
used up in the main tank, if the additional tank has at least `1` liters of
fuel, `1` liters of fuel will be transferred from the additional tank to the
main tank.

Return _the maximum distance which can be traveled._

**Note:** Injection from the additional tank is not continuous. It happens
suddenly and immediately for every 5 liters consumed.



**Example 1:**
            Input: mainTank = 5, additionalTank = 10    Output: 60    Explanation:     After spending 5 litre of fuel, fuel remaining is (5 - 5 + 1) = 1 litre and distance traveled is 50km.    After spending another 1 litre of fuel, no fuel gets injected in the main tank and the main tank becomes empty.    Total distance traveled is 60km.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: mainTank = 1, additionalTank = 2    Output: 10    Explanation:     After spending 1 litre of fuel, the main tank becomes empty.    Total distance traveled is 10km.

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` containing **distinct** **positive** integers,
find and return **any** number from the array that is neither the **minimum**
nor the **maximum** value in the array, or **`-1`** if there is no such
number.

Return _the selected integer._



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]    Output: 2    Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [1,2]    Output: -1    Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [2,1,3]    Output: 2    Explanation: Since 2 is neither the maximum nor the minimum value in nums, it is the only valid answer.     



**Constraints:**

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` containing **distinct** **positive** integers,
find and return **any** number from the array that is neither the **minimum**
nor the **maximum** value in the array, or **`-1`** if there is no such
number.

Return _the selected integer._



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]    Output: 2    Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [1,2]    Output: -1    Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [2,1,3]    Output: 2    Explanation: Since 2 is neither the maximum nor the minimum value in nums, it is the only valid answer.     



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
  * All values in `nums` are distinct

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** permutation of `n` integers `nums`.

A permutation is called **semi-ordered** if the first number equals `1` and
the last number equals `n`. You can perform the below operation as many times
as you want until you make `nums` a **semi-ordered** permutation:

  * Pick two adjacent elements in `nums`, then swap them.

Return _the minimum number of operations to make_`nums` _a **semi-ordered
permutation**_.

A **permutation** is a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` of length `n`
containing each number exactly once.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,1,4,3]    Output: 2    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:     1 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    2 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than two operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.     

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [2,4,1,3]    Output: 3    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:    1 - swap i = 1 and j = 2. The permutation becomes [2,1,4,3].    2 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    3 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than three operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,5]    Output: 0    Explanation: The permutation is already a semi-ordered permutation.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length == n <= 50`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
  * `nums is a permutation.`

        ",,"The problem can be solved by using the concept of longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The idea is to find the longest increasing subsequence in the given array. The length of this subsequence represents the number of elements that are already in their correct positions. The remaining elements need to be moved to their correct positions, which can be done by swapping adjacent elements. The minimum number of such operations required is equal to the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

```

In the code, we first initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n` with all elements as `1`. This is because a single element is always an increasing subsequence of length `1`. Then for each element in the array, we check all the previous elements. If the current element is greater than a previous element, it means that the current element can be appended to the increasing subsequence ending at the previous element. So, we update the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the current element as the maximum of its current length and the length of the increasing subsequence ending at the previous element plus `1`. Finally, we return the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence as the minimum number of operations required to make the permutation semi-ordered.",48.78547787666321,0.04011,20230711,"07/11/2023, 01:47:29","  [38;5;196m✘ Runtime Error[39m

    The problem can be solved by using the concept of longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The idea is to find the longest increasing subsequence in the given array. The length of this subsequence represents the number of elements that are already in their correct positions. The remaining elements need to be moved to their correct positions, which can be done by swapping adjacent elements. The minimum number of such operations required is equal to the total number of elements minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** permutation of `n` integers `nums`.

A permutation is called **semi-ordered** if the first number equals `1` and
the last number equals `n`. You can perform the below operation as many times
as you want until you make `nums` a **semi-ordered** permutation:

  * Pick two adjacent elements in `nums`, then swap them.

Return _the minimum number of operations to make_`nums` _a **semi-ordered
permutation**_.

A **permutation** is a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` of length `n`
containing each number exactly once.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [2,1,4,3]    Output: 2    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:     1 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    2 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than two operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.     

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [2,4,1,3]    Output: 3    Explanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:    1 - swap i = 1 and j = 2. The permutation becomes [2,1,4,3].    2 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].    3 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].    It can be proved that there is no sequence of less than three operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,5]    Output: 0    Explanation: The permutation is already a semi-ordered permutation.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length == n <= 50`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
  * `nums is a permutation.`

## Description

Given a **0-indexed** string `s`, repeatedly perform the following operation
**any** number of times:

  * Choose an index `i` in the string, and let `c` be the character in position `i`. **Delete** the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **left** of `i` (if any) and the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **right** of `i` (if any).

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `s` by performing the above
operation any number of times.

Return _an integer denoting the length of the **minimized** string._



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = ""aaabc""    Output: 3    Explanation: In this example, s is ""aaabc"". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes ""abc"". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = ""cbbd""    Output: 3    Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes ""cbd"" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3.     

**Example 3:**
            Input: s = ""dddaaa""    Output: 2    Explanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes ""daaa"". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes ""da"". We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.

## Description

Given a **0-indexed** string `s`, repeatedly perform the following operation
**any** number of times:

  * Choose an index `i` in the string, and let `c` be the character in position `i`. **Delete** the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **left** of `i` (if any) and the **closest occurrence** of `c` to the **right** of `i` (if any).

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `s` by performing the above
operation any number of times.

Return _an integer denoting the length of the **minimized** string._



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = ""aaabc""    Output: 3    Explanation: In this example, s is ""aaabc"". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes ""abc"". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = ""cbbd""    Output: 3    Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes ""cbd"" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3.     

**Example 3:**
            Input: s = ""dddaaa""    Output: 2    Explanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes ""daaa"". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes ""da"". We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.    





**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` contains only lowercase English letters


**Tags:** Hash Table, String

## Description

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the prices of various
chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer `money`, which
represents your initial amount of money.

You must buy **exactly** two chocolates in such a way that you still have some
**non-negative** leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the
prices of the two chocolates you buy.

Return _the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two
chocolates_. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending
up in debt, return `money`. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.



**Example 1:**
            Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3    Output: 0    Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.

## Description

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the prices of various
chocolates in a store. You are also given a single integer `money`, which
represents your initial amount of money.

You must buy **exactly** two chocolates in such a way that you still have some
**non-negative** leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the
prices of the two chocolates you buy.

Return _the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two
chocolates_. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending
up in debt, return `money`. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting only of **uppercase** English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can
remove **any** occurrence of one of the substrings `""AB""` or `""CD""` from `s`.

Return _the **minimum** possible length of the resulting string that you can
obtain_.

**Note** that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could
produce new `""AB""` or `""CD""` substrings.



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = ""ABFCACDB""    Output: 2    Explanation: We can do the following operations:    - Remove the substring "" _AB_ FCACDB"", so s = ""FCACDB"".    - Remove the substring ""FCA _CD_ B"", so s = ""FCAB"".    - Remove the substring ""FC _AB_ "", so s = ""FC"".    So the resulting length of the string is 2.    It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = ""ACBBD""    Output: 5    Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` consists only of uppercase English letters.

## Description

There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a
circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in **clockwise order**. More formally,
moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for
`1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the
`1st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

`1st` friend receives the ball.

  * After that, `1st` friend passes it to the friend who is `k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `2 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `3 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the `ith` turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it
to the friend who is `i * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise**
direction.

The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.

The **losers** of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the
entire game.

Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return _the array
answer, which contains the losers of the game in the **ascending** order_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 5, k = 2    Output: [4,5]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 2 steps away from them - 3rd friend.    2) 3rd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 2nd friend.    3) 2nd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 6 steps away from them  - 3rd friend.    4) The game ends as 3rd friend receives the ball for the second time.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 4, k = 4    Output: [2,3,4]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at the 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 1st friend.    2) The game ends as 1st friend receives the ball for the second time.

## Description

There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a
circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in **clockwise order**. More formally,
moving clockwise from the `ith` friend brings you to the `(i+1)th` friend for
`1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `nth` friend brings you to the
`1st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

`1st` friend receives the ball.

  * After that, `1st` friend passes it to the friend who is `k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `2 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction.
  * After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is `3 * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise** direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the `ith` turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it
to the friend who is `i * k` steps away from them in the **clockwise**
direction.

The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time.

The **losers** of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the
entire game.

Given the number of friends, `n`, and an integer `k`, return _the array
answer, which contains the losers of the game in the **ascending** order_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 5, k = 2    Output: [4,5]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 2 steps away from them - 3rd friend.    2) 3rd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 2nd friend.    3) 2nd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 6 steps away from them  - 3rd friend.    4) The game ends as 3rd friend receives the ball for the second time.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 4, k = 4    Output: [2,3,4]    Explanation: The game goes as follows:    1) Start at the 1st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 1st friend.    2) The game ends as 1st friend receives the ball for the second time.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= n <= 50`

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `details`. Each element of
`details` provides information about a given passenger compressed into a
string of length `15`. The system is such that:

  * The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
  * The next character denotes the gender of the person.
  * The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
  * The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.

Return _the number of passengers who are **strictly** **more than 60 years
old**._



**Example 1:**
            Input: details = [""7868190130M7522"",""5303914400F9211"",""9273338290F4010""]    Output: 2    Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: details = [""1313579440F2036"",""2921522980M5644""]    Output: 0    Explanation: None of the passengers are older than 60.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= details.length <= 100`
  * `details[i].length == 15`
  * `details[i] consists of digits from '0' to '9'.`
  * `details[i][10] is either 'M' or 'F' or 'O'.`
  * The phone numbers and seat numbers of the passengers are distinct.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`.

The **distinct difference** array of `nums` is an array `diff` of length `n`
such that `diff[i]` is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix
`nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]` **subtracted from** the number of distinct elements
in the prefix `nums[0, ..., i]`.

Return _the **distinct difference** array of _`nums`.

Note that `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index
`i` and ending at index `j` inclusive. Particularly, if `i > j` then `nums[i,
..., j]` denotes an empty subarray.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]    Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]    Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.    For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.    For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.    For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.    For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]    Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]    Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.    For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.    For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.    For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.    For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `player1` and `player2`, that
represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game,
respectively.

The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is
exactly `10`.

Assume a player hit `xi` pins in the `ith` turn. The value of the `ith` turn
for the player is:

  * `2xi` if the player hit `10` pins in any of the previous two turns.
  * Otherwise, It is `xi`.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.

Return

  * `1` _if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,_
  * `2` _if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and_
  * `0` _in case of a draw._



**Example 1:**
            Input: player1 = [4,10,7,9], player2 = [6,5,2,3]    Output: 1    Explanation: The score of player1 is 4 + 10 + 2*7 + 2*9 = 46.    The score of player2 is 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16.    Score of player1 is more than the score of player2, so, player1 is the winner, and the answer is 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]    Output: 2    Explanation: The score of player1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.    The score of player2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.    Score of player2 is more than the score of player1, so, player2 is the winner, and the answer is 2.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]    Output: 0    Explanation: The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5    The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5    The score of player1 equals to the score of player2, so, there is a draw, and the answer is 0.        



**Constraints:**

  * `n == player1.length == player2.length`

represent the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game,
respectively.

The bowling game consists of `n` turns, and the number of pins in each turn is
exactly `10`.

Assume a player hit `xi` pins in the `ith` turn. The value of the `ith` turn
for the player is:

  * `2xi` if the player hit `10` pins in any of the previous two turns.
  * Otherwise, It is `xi`.

The score of the player is the sum of the values of their `n` turns.

Return

  * `1` _if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,_
  * `2` _if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and_
  * `0` _in case of a draw._



**Example 1:**
            Input: player1 = [4,10,7,9], player2 = [6,5,2,3]    Output: 1    Explanation: The score of player1 is 4 + 10 + 2*7 + 2*9 = 46.    The score of player2 is 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 16.    Score of player1 is more than the score of player2, so, player1 is the winner, and the answer is 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]    Output: 2    Explanation: The score of player1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.    The score of player2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.    Score of player2 is more than the score of player1, so, player2 is the winner, and the answer is 2.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]    Output: 0    Explanation: The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5    The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5    The score of player1 equals to the score of player2, so, there is a draw, and the answer is 0.        



**Constraints:**

  * `n == player1.length == player2.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 1000`
  * `0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10`

            Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3    Output: 18    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.    For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]    For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]    For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]    So, we will return 18.    It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2    Output: 11    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.    For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]    For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]    So, we will return 11.    It can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your
task is to perform the following operation **exactly** `k` times in order to
maximize your score:

  1. Select an element `m` from `nums`.
  2. Remove the selected element `m` from the array.
  3. Add a new element with a value of `m + 1` to the array.
  4. Increase your score by `m`.

Return _the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation
exactly_ `k` _times._



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3    Output: 18    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.    For the first iteration, we choose 5.

## Description

You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a
train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount
of delay in hours.

Return _the time when the train will arrive at the station._

Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.



**Example 1:**
            Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5     Output: 20     Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).    

**Example 2:**
            Input: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11    Output: 0    Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arrivaltime < 24`
  * `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`


**Tags:** Math

## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`.

The **divisibility score** of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices `j` such
that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`.

Return _the integer_ `divisors[i]` _with the maximum divisibility score_. If

them.



**Example 1:**

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, find the **0-indexed** position of the
row that contains the **maximum** count of **ones,** and the number of ones in
that row.

In case there are multiple rows that have the maximum count of ones, the row
with the **smallest row number** should be selected.

Return _an array containing the index of the row, and the number of ones in
it._



**Example 1:**
            Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]    Output: [0,1]    Explanation: Both rows have the same number of 1's. So we return the index of the smaller row, 0, and the maximum count of ones (1). So, the answer is [0,1].     

**Example 2:**
            Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1]]    Output: [1,2]    Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So we return its index, 1, and the count. So, the answer is [1,2].    

**Example 3:**
            Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,0]]    Output: [1,2]    Explanation: The row indexed 1 has the maximum count of ones (2). So the answer is [1,2].    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length` 
  * `n == mat[i].length` 
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100` 
  * `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a
column is the maximum **length** of its integers.

  * For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is of length `3`.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a
column is the maximum **length** of its integers.

  * For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is of length `3`.

Return _an integer array_ `ans` _of size_ `n` _where_ `ans[i]` _is the width
of the_ `ith` _column_.

The **length** of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is
non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.



**Example 1:**
            Input: grid = [[1],[22],[333]]    Output: [3]    Explanation: In the 0th column, 333 is of length 3.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: grid = [[-15,1,3],[15,7,12],[5,6,-2]]    Output: [3,1,2]    Explanation:     In the 0th column, only -15 is of length 3.    In the 1st column, all integers are of length 1.     In the 2nd column, both 12 and -2 are of length 2.    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100 `
  * `-109 <= grid[r][c] <= 109`

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed two-dimensional integer array `nums`.

Return _the largest **prime** number that lies on at least one of the
**diagonals** of _`nums`. In case, no prime is present on any of the
diagonals, return _0._

Note that:

  * An integer is **prime** if it is greater than `1` and has no positive integer divisors other than `1` and itself.
  * An integer `val` is on one of the **diagonals** of `nums` if there exists an integer `i` for which `nums[i][i] = val` or an `i` for which `nums[i][nums.length - i - 1] = val`.

            Input: s = ""01000111""    Output: 6    Explanation: The longest balanced substring is ""000111"", which has length 6.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = ""00111""    Output: 4    Explanation: The longest balanced substring is ""0011"", which has length 4.     

**Example 3:**
            Input: s = ""111""    Output: 0    Explanation: There is no balanced substring except the empty substring, so the answer is 0.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 50`
  * `'0' <= s[i] <= '1'`


**Tags:** String

## Description

You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of zeroes and ones.

A substring of `s` is considered balanced if **all zeroes are before ones**
and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring.
Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.

Return _the length of the longest balanced substring of_`s`.

## Description

There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number `1`, `0`, or
`-1` written on it.

You are given four **non-negative** integers `numOnes`, `numZeros`,
`numNegOnes`, and `k`.

The bag initially contains:

  * `numOnes` items with `1`s written on them.
  * `numZeroes` items with `0`s written on them.
  * `numNegOnes` items with `-1`s written on them.

We want to pick exactly `k` items among the available items. Return _the
**maximum** possible sum of numbers written on the items_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 2    Output: 2    Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 2 items with 1 written on them and get a sum in a total of 2.    It can be proven that 2 is the maximum possible sum.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 4    Output: 3    Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 3 items with 1 written on them, and 1 item with 0 written on it, and get a sum in a total of 3.    It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible sum.    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes <= 50`
  * `0 <= k <= numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes`

## Description

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of
`n` ( **0-indexed** ) with value `1`.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n`
( **0-indexed** ) with value `1`.

Return _an integer array_`answer` _where_`answer = [even, odd]`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 17    Output: [2,0]    Explanation: The binary representation of 17 is 10001.     It contains 1 on the 0th and 4th indices.     There are 2 even and 0 odd indices.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 2    Output: [0,1]    Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10.    It contains 1 on the 1st index.     There are 0 even and 1 odd indices.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of string `words` and two integers `left`
and `right`.

A string is called a **vowel string** if it starts with a vowel character and
ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`,
`'o'`, and `'u'`.

Return _the number of vowel strings_`words[i]` _where_`i` _belongs to the
inclusive range_`[left, right]`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: words = [""are"",""amy"",""u""], left = 0, right = 2    Output: 2    Explanation:     - ""are"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.    - ""amy"" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.    - ""u"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of string `words` and two integers `left`
and `right`.

A string is called a **vowel string** if it starts with a vowel character and
ends with a vowel character where vowel characters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`,
`'o'`, and `'u'`.

Return _the number of vowel strings_`words[i]` _where_`i` _belongs to the
inclusive range_`[left, right]`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: words = [""are"",""amy"",""u""], left = 0, right = 2    Output: 2    Explanation:     - ""are"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'.    - ""amy"" is not a vowel string because it does not end with a vowel.    - ""u"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'u' and ends with 'u'.    The number of vowel strings in the mentioned range is 2.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""hey"",""aeo"",""mu"",""ooo"",""artro""], left = 1, right = 4    Output: 3    Explanation:     - ""aeo"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.    - ""mu"" is not a vowel string because it does not start with a vowel.    - ""ooo"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'o' and ends with 'o'.    - ""artro"" is a vowel string because it starts with 'a' and ends with 'o'.

## Description

There are `n` people standing in a line labeled from `1` to `n`. The first
person in the line is holding a pillow initially. Every second, the person
holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the
pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue
passing the pillow in the opposite direction.

  * For example, once the pillow reaches the `nth` person they pass it to the `n - 1th` person, then to the `n - 2th` person and so on.

Given the two positive integers `n` and `time`, return _the index of the
person holding the pillow after_`time` _seconds_.



**Example 1:**

## Description

There are `n` people standing in a line labeled from `1` to `n`. The first
person in the line is holding a pillow initially. Every second, the person
holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the
pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue
passing the pillow in the opposite direction.

  * For example, once the pillow reaches the `nth` person they pass it to the `n - 1th` person, then to the `n - 2th` person and so on.

Given the two positive integers `n` and `time`, return _the index of the
person holding the pillow after_`time` _seconds_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 4, time = 5    Output: 2    Explanation: People pass the pillow in the following way: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.    Afer five seconds, the pillow is given to the 2nd person.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 3, time = 2    Output: 3    Explanation: People pass the pillow in the following way: 1 -> 2 -> 3.    Afer two seconds, the pillow is given to the 3rd person.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 1000`
  * `1 <= time <= 1000`

## Description

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1`
and `num2` such that:

  * The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` is a permutation of `num`.     * In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
  * `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.

Return _the **minimum** possible sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2`.

**Notes:**

  * It is guaranteed that `num` does not contain any leading zeros.
  * The order of occurrence of the digits in `num1` and `num2` may differ from the order of occurrence of `num`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 4325    Output: 59    Explanation: We can split 4325 so that num1 is 24 and num2 is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 687    Output: 75    Explanation: We can split 687 so that num1 is 68 and num2 is 7, which would give an optimal sum of 75.

## Description

You are given two **2D** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2.`

  * `nums1[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.
  * `nums2[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.

Each array contains **unique** ids and is sorted in **ascending** order by id.

Merge the two arrays into one array that is sorted in ascending order by id,
respecting the following conditions:

  * Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
  * Each id should be included **only once** and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays then its value in that array is considered to be `0`.

Return _the resulting array_. The returned array must be sorted in ascending
order by id.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,5]], nums2 = [[1,4],[3,2],[4,1]]    Output: [[1,6],[2,3],[3,2],[4,6]]    Explanation: The resulting array contains the following:    - id = 1, the value of this id is 2 + 4 = 6.    - id = 2, the value of this id is 3.    - id = 3, the value of this id is 2.    - id = 4, the value of this id is 5 + 1 = 6.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [[2,4],[3,6],[5,5]], nums2 = [[1,3],[4,3]]    Output: [[1,3],[2,4],[3,6],[4,3],[5,5]]    Explanation: There are no common ids, so we just include each id with its value in the resulting list.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 200`
  * `nums1[i].length == nums2[j].length == 2`
  * `1 <= idi, vali <= 1000`
  * Both arrays contain unique ids.
  * Both arrays are in strictly ascending order by id.

## Description

You are given two **2D** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2.`

  * `nums1[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.
  * `nums2[i] = [idi, vali]` indicate that the number with the id `idi` has a value equal to `vali`.

Each array contains **unique** ids and is sorted in **ascending** order by id.

Merge the two arrays into one array that is sorted in ascending order by id,
respecting the following conditions:

  * Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
  * Each id should be included **only once** and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays then its value in that array is considered to be `0`.

Return _the resulting array_. The returned array must be sorted in ascending
order by id.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,5]], nums2 = [[1,4],[3,2],[4,1]]    Output: [[1,6],[2,3],[3,2],[4,6]]    Explanation: The resulting array contains the following:    - id = 1, the value of this id is 2 + 4 = 6.    - id = 2, the value of this id is 3.    - id = 3, the value of this id is 2.    - id = 4, the value of this id is 5 + 1 = 6.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [[2,4],[3,6],[5,5]], nums2 = [[1,3],[4,3]]    Output: [[1,3],[2,4],[3,6],[4,3],[5,5]]    Explanation: There are no common ids, so we just include each id with its value in the resulting list.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 200`
  * `nums1[i].length == nums2[j].length == 2`
  * `1 <= idi, vali <= 1000`
  * Both arrays contain unique ids.
  * Both arrays are in strictly ascending order by id.

## Description

You are given an integer `num`. You know that Danny Mittal will sneakily
**remap** one of the `10` possible digits (`0` to `9`) to another digit.

Return _the difference between the maximum and minimum_ _  values Danny can
make by remapping  **exactly** **one** digit_ _in_`num`.

**Notes:**

  * When Danny remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Danny replaces all occurrences of `d1` in `num` with `d2`.
  * Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.
  * Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
  * The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.

To achieve the minimum value, Danny can remap the digit 1 to the digit 0, yielding 890.    The difference between these two numbers is 99009.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 90    Output: 99    Explanation:    The maximum value that can be returned by the function is 99 (if 0 is replaced by 9) and the minimum value that can be returned by the function is 0 (if 9 is replaced by 0).    Thus, we return 99.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **concatenation** of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating
their numerals.

  * For example, the concatenation of `15`, `49` is `1549`.

The **concatenation value** of `nums` is initially equal to `0`. Perform this
operation until `nums` becomes empty:

  * If there exists more than one number in `nums`, pick the first element and last element in `nums` respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete the first and last element from `nums`.
  * If one element exists, add its value to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete it.

Return _the concatenation value of the`nums`_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]    Output: 596    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.    Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.    Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.    Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.    Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [5,14,13,8,12]    Output: 673    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.    Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.    Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].     - In the third operation:    nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`.

The **concatenation** of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating
their numerals.

  * For example, the concatenation of `15`, `49` is `1549`.

The **concatenation value** of `nums` is initially equal to `0`. Perform this
operation until `nums` becomes empty:

  * If there exists more than one number in `nums`, pick the first element and last element in `nums` respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete the first and last element from `nums`.
  * If one element exists, add its value to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete it.

Return _the concatenation value of the`nums`_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]    Output: 596    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.    Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.    Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.    Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.    Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [5,14,13,8,12]    Output: 673    Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0.     - In the first operation:    We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.    Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].     - In the second operation:    We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.    Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.    Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].     - In the third operation:    nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.

## Description

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various
piles. Every second, you do the following:

  * Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
  * If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
  * Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

## Description

You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various
piles. Every second, you do the following:

  * Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
  * If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
  * Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.

Return _the number of gifts remaining after_`k` _seconds._



**Example 1:**
            Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4    Output: 29    Explanation:     The gifts are taken in the following way:    - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.    - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.    - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.    - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.    The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4    Output: 4    Explanation:     In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile.     That is, you can't take any pile with you.     So, the total gifts remaining are 4.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= gifts.length <= 103`
  * `1 <= gifts[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= 103`

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board.
Every day, for `109` days, you perform the following procedure:

  * For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.
  * Then, place those numbers on the board.

**Note:**

  * Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
  * `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 5    Output: 4    Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board.     The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1.     After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1.     At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5.

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, that is initially placed on a board.
Every day, for `109` days, you perform the following procedure:

  * For each number `x` present on the board, find all numbers `1 <= i <= n` such that `x % i == 1`.
  * Then, place those numbers on the board.

Return _the number of **distinct** integers present on the board after_ `109`
_days have elapsed_.

**Note:**

  * Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
  * `%` stands for the modulo operation. For example, `14 % 3` is `2`.

## Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order,
return _the **minimum integer common** to both arrays_. If there is no common
integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`.

Note that an integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both
arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]    Output: 2    Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

## Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order,
return _the **minimum integer common** to both arrays_. If there is no common
integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`.

Note that an integer is said to be **common** to `nums1` and `nums2` if both
arrays have **at least one** occurrence of that integer.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]    Output: 2    Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`
  * Both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Description

Given an array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _the maximum
between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers._

  * In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`.

**Note** that `0` is neither positive nor negative.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [-2,-1,-1,1,2,3]    Output: 3    Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]    Output: 3    Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: nums = [5,20,66,1314]    Output: 4    Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
  * `-2000 <= nums[i] <= 2000`
  * `nums` is sorted in a **non-decreasing order**.



**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(log(n))` time complexity?

## Description

Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the
dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the
**category** of the box_.

  * The box is `""Bulky""` if:     * **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to `104`.    * Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to `109`.
  * If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `""Heavy"".`
  * If the box is both `""Bulky""` and `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Both""`.
  * If the box is neither `""Bulky""` nor `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Neither""`.
  * If the box is `""Bulky""` but not `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Bulky""`.
  * If the box is `""Heavy""` but not `""Bulky""`, then its category is `""Heavy""`.

**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and
height.



**Example 1:**
            Input: length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300    Output: ""Heavy""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.     Its volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    However mass >= 100, so the box is ""Heavy"".    Since the box is not ""Bulky"" but ""Heavy"", we return ""Heavy"".

**Example 2:**
            Input: length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50    Output: ""Neither""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.    Its volume = 8 * 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    Its mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as ""Heavy"" either.     Since its neither of the two above categories, we return ""Neither"".

Given four integers `length`, `width`, `height`, and `mass`, representing the
dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return _a string representing the
**category** of the box_.

  * The box is `""Bulky""` if:     * **Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to `104`.    * Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to `109`.
  * If the mass of the box is greater or equal to `100`, it is `""Heavy"".`
  * If the box is both `""Bulky""` and `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Both""`.
  * If the box is neither `""Bulky""` nor `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Neither""`.
  * If the box is `""Bulky""` but not `""Heavy""`, then its category is `""Bulky""`.
  * If the box is `""Heavy""` but not `""Bulky""`, then its category is `""Heavy""`.

**Note** that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and
height.



**Example 1:**
            Input: length = 1000, width = 35, height = 700, mass = 300    Output: ""Heavy""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.     Its volume = 24500000 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    However mass >= 100, so the box is ""Heavy"".    Since the box is not ""Bulky"" but ""Heavy"", we return ""Heavy"".

**Example 2:**
            Input: length = 200, width = 50, height = 800, mass = 50    Output: ""Neither""    Explanation:     None of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to 104.    Its volume = 8 * 106 <= 109. So it cannot be categorized as ""Bulky"".    Its mass is also less than 100, so it cannot be categorized as ""Heavy"" either.     Since its neither of the two above categories, we return ""Neither"".



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= length, width, height <= 105`
  * `1 <= mass <= 103`

## Description

Given an integer `num`, return _the number of digits in`num` that divide
_`num`.

An integer `val` divides `nums` if `nums % val == 0`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 7    Output: 1    Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 121    Output: 2    Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: num = 1248    Output: 4    Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** **circular** string array `words` and a string
`target`. A **circular array** means that the array's end connects to the
array's beginning.

  * Formally, the next element of `words[i]` is `words[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `words[i]` is `words[(i - 1 + n) % n]`, where `n` is the length of `words`.

previous word with `1` step at a time.

Return _the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string_ `target`. If the
string `target` does not exist in `words`, return `-1`.

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `forts` of length `n` representing
the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:

  * `-1` represents there is **no fort** at the `ith` position.
  * `0` indicates there is an **enemy** fort at the `ith` position.
  * `1` indicates the fort at the `ith` the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i`

  * `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`
  * The army travels over enemy forts **only**. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0.`

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are
**captured**.

Return _the **maximum** number of enemy forts that can be captured_. In case
it is **impossible** to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your
command, return `0` _._

Here is the Python code:

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string array `words`.

Two strings are **similar** if they consist of the same characters.

  * For example, `""abca""` and `""cba""` are similar since both consist of characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
  * However, `""abacba""` and `""bcfd""` are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return _the number of pairs_`(i, j)` _such that_`0 <= i < j <= word.length -
1` _and the two strings_`words[i]` _and_`words[j]` _are similar_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: words = [""aba"",""aabb"",""abcd"",""bac"",""aabc""]    Output: 2    Explanation: There are 2 pairs that satisfy the conditions:    - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.     - i = 3 and j = 4 : both words[3] and words[4] only consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.     

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = [""aabb"",""ab"",""ba""]    Output: 3    Explanation: There are 3 pairs that satisfy the conditions:    - i = 0 and j = 1 : both words[0] and words[1] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.     - i = 0 and j = 2 : both words[0] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.    - i = 1 and j = 2 : both words[1] and words[2] only consist of characters 'a' and 'b'.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: words = [""nba"",""cba"",""dba""]    Output: 0    Explanation: Since there does not exist any pair that satisfies the conditions, we return 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
  * `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until `grid` becomes empty:

  * Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
  * Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.

**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return _the answer after performing the operations described above_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex1.jpg)
            Input: grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]    Output: 8    Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.    - In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.    - In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.    - In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.    The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex2.jpg)
            Input: grid = [[10]]    Output: 10    Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.    - In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.    The final answer = 10.    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 50`
  * `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`


**Tags:** Array, Sorting, Matrix
